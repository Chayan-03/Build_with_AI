# Generative Assistant

This project is a simple Generative Assistant application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that allows users to upload images or enter text prompts to receive AI-generated summaries or responses. The app uses Googleâ€™s generative AI model, configured via the [google-generativeai](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/) Python package, to process and respond to user inputs.

## Features

- **Text Prompt Responses:** Enter any text prompt, and the model generates an AI-powered response.
- **Document Interaction:** Upload an image/doc along with a prompt, and the app provides a summarized response.
- **Interactive UI:** A simple and user-friendly interface for uploading files and receiving outputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Generative AI API Key

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chayan-03/Build_with_AI.git
    cd generative-assistant
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, then run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -U google-generativeai
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your Google Generative AI API key:

      ```plaintext
      API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key
      ```


4. **Run the Application:**

    Start the Streamlit app with the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Replace `app.py` with the actual file name of the main script if it differs.


5. **Access the Application:**

    Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:<port_number>` to interact with the app.
## Using the Docker Image 
   Instead of manually installing dependencies, you can use Docker to run the application. The prebuilt image is available on Docker Hub.
1. **Pull the Docker Image from Docker Hub**
   ```bash
   docker chayan03/generative-assistant:latest
   ```
2. **Run the Docker Container by providing your Gemini API key as -**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 -e API_KEY="your_google_api_key" your_dockerhub_username/generative-assistant
   ```
   Now, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the app.

## Usage

1. **Text Prompts:**
   - Enter a question or prompt in the text area and click **Submit**. The app will display an AI-generated response.

2. **Doc Summarization:**
   - Upload an image/doc and enter a related prompt, then click **Submit**. The app will provide a summary based on the content of the image and prompt.
